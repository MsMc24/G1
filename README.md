## What is Voki?🤔🤔🤔
Voki is an educational tool for teachers and students that can be used to enhance instruction, engagement, and lesson comprehension using an avatar.

Converting text to speech, Voki’s main function, is a way to not only help visually impaired people but to help language learners. It can be used when a student is too shy to speak, is uncertain how to pronounce words or even if a student doesn’t have a microphone. 

Creating an avatar can be motivating for students because they create someone to read their words and get to hear their words aloud which lowers their affective filter because of less pressure to speak.  

## Voki: Free 🆓 or Paid?🤑
**Free version** includes creating avatars, 3 presentations with 3 slides, 1 classroom with 5 students, 1 hangout with 5 students.

**Paid plans** vary depending on the number of student accounts that can be assigned, classrooms, presenters, hangouts.
