## What is Voki?🤔🤔🤔
📝 Voki is an educational tool for teachers and students that can be used to enhance instruction, engagement, and lesson comprehension using an avatar.

📝 Converting text to speech, Voki’s main function, is a way to not only help visually impaired people but to help language learners. It can be used when a student is too shy to speak, is uncertain how to pronounce words or even if a student doesn’t have a microphone. 

📝 Voki offers three subscription-types:
<br />
➡️ Creator is where you can create your character, and it is free. It is similar to the Voki app.<br />
➡️ Presenter is where you can make a presentation using voki character, text, image, video, shape,
and you can align features and decorate background and surface as well. You can only create 3
presentations with 3 slides for free. If you want to make more slides, you have to pay for
subscription. <br />
➡️ Classroom is a management tool where teachers can create a class, assign homework, manage
and monitor students and their classwork. Teachers can review students’ submissions in real-
time, either from desktop or mobile device. Teacehrs can assign each student a login, so
there’s no need for studetns to register or provide personal information. You can create 1
classroom with 5 studetns for free.
