📝 Voki is an educational tool for teachers and students that can be used to enhance instruction, engagement, and lesson comprehension using an avatar.

📝 Converting text to speech, Voki’s main function, is a way to not only help visually impaired people but to help language learners. It can be used when a student is too shy to speak, is uncertain how to pronounce words or even if a student doesn’t have a microphone. 

📝 <ins> Voki offers four levels within four subscription-types: </ins>
