👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻 A Hangout is a student learning community or forum designed to foster student interaction and conversation and decrease students' affective filter that can be present in a face-to-face setting by using Voki speaking avatars. 

👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻 Each Hangout contains teacher chosen Topics in which students can respond with related Thoughts that are displayed with their speaking avatar by utilizing the text-to-speech function.

👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻 These Thoughts are displayed in a teacher managed, conversational grid so that while it encourages dialogue and learning, the teacher is able to monitor the conversations.

Hangouts are a great way to facilitate interaction and collaboration in the classroom while taking the pressure off students.
